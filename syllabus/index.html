				<h2>Course Structure</h2>


				<p><b>Capstone Project</b>:
			    This course is primarily oriented around producing a capstone project as a group.
			    Every class will incorporate some dedicated
			    time to work on the project, and there will be group assignments due at regular milestones.
			    Groups will be formed during the first week of class.
			    Groups will be expected to give updates to the rest of the class throughout the quarter after milestones and gather feedback.
			    Each group will also be expected to have at least one 10 minute check-in per week with Amy or Ruotong sometime during group work time.
			    The project will culminate in a Final Showcase where students can demo their projects to the public.
				</p>
			  	<p><b>In-class Lectures, Discussion, and Activities</b>:
			    The other main part of class will involve short lectures, class discussion, and activities that cover different major social
			    computing topics relevant to current events and our everyday lives.
			    We will recap readings that were assigned, discuss students' reflections, and students will
			    present their assignments. Active participation by all students will be expected.
			    On one or two occasions, we will have a guest speaker come visit the class.
				</p>
				<p><b>Reading and Reflections</b>:
			    Each class we will have ~1-2 assigned short readings related to the social computing topic of the day.
			    We will be using Hypothes.is as a way for all of us to read together
			    and collectively annotate the reading before class with our thoughts.
			    Students are expected to leave at least one comment per reading responding to any of the reflection prompts posted on Hypothes.is.
				</p>
				<P>
					<b>Assignments</b>: There are <s>5</s> 4 individual assignments during the course for students to
					do some hands-on exploration, sharing, and deeper reflection on course topics related to social computing.
			    These assignments will be presented and discussed
					during class time.

				</P>


				<div class="subsection" id="expectations"  data-href="index.html#expectations" data-level="1" class="side-nav-header">
					<h3>Expectations</h3>
					<h4>Participation and Preparation</h4>
					<P>
					You are expected to attend and actively participate in every class session.
				  I expect you to be respectful to your teammates and contribute equally to the work. If there come situations where you are unable to
				  contribute equally, I expect you to communicate this to your teammates and to find a way to make it up to them.
					To make the most of the class, I expect you to be on time and to have completed any readings before class.
					Finally, I expect you to actively participate in conversation and feedback and be respectful and attentive towards any group presenters and guest visitors.
					</p><P>
						If you can't make class because of an extenuating circumstance, please let me know before class, and I can excuse you. You will
						still be expected to complete any readings, responses, group work, and assignments related to the class that you miss.
					</P>
					</P><BR>

						<h4>Deadlines and Extensions</h4>
					<P>
					Deadlines are primarily there to help the class run smoothly, as milestones build on each other.
					However, if you or your group has an extenuating circumstance or just could really use extra hours or a day,
				  definitely reach out to me about receiving an extension!
					Please be proactive in letting me know about things
				  that come up instead of telling me after the fact so that we can plan together and
					others are not disrupted.
					</P><BR>

					<h4>A Note on Diversity and Respectful Conduct</h4>
					<p>This course welcomes all students of all backgrounds. The computer science and computer engineering
						industries have significant lack of diversity. This is due to a lack of sufficient past efforts
						by the field toward even greater diversity, equity, and inclusion. The Allen School seeks
						to create a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable environment for our community and our
						field. You should expect and demand to be treated by your classmates and myself
						with respect. If any incident occurs that challenges this commitment to a supportive, diverse,
						inclusive, and equitable environment, please let me know so the issue can be addressed.</p>

					  <h3>Contribution Statements</h3>

						<P>
						Please write and submit a <b>personal contribution statement</b> using <a href="https://forms.gle/6npshgAWisQJtAwY8">this Google Form</a> every time that you
						submit a group assignment. This allows you to personally specify what proportion you contributed to the work done by the group.
						</p>
						<P>
						The statement should include (1): your estimate of the percent of group work completed by you, and (2) a summary of the work you did. For example, your statement could be: “40%, researched the background of the problem, outlined the content of the document, wrote the first version of one paragraph, also selected the images to be included.”
						</P>
						<P>
						Please know that we do not expect everyone to contribute equally to each assignment, but you should try to work as a team and support each other. Please come to us early if you are dealing with unresolved issues regarding unequal contributions. During the quarter, we may solicit private feedback regarding group dynamics from members.
